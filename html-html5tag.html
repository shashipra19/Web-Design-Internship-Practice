  <h3>Statue of Unity</h3>
  <p>The Statue of Unity is the statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel. He is popularly referred to as the Iron Man of India. Post Indiaâ€™s independence in 1947, he played a pivotal role in bringing all the then-disjointed princely states into the Union of India. As a tribute to his towering personality, the statue, the tallest statue in the world, is rightly called the Statue of Unity. <br>
The enigma of this visit to the Statue of Unity starts with its story. In 2013 kits were sent to nearly 169000 villages of India to collect soil and iron of the discarded farming equipment. In three years, 135 metric tonnes of iron was collected and eventually used in the formation of the Statue of Unity. The personification of the name of this record-breaking statue by way of this lohi campaign was commendable and made for a wonderful back story for our visit to the Statue of Unity.</p>
